# Lamdera Project Rules

## Development Server
- The Lamdera dev server runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- Start the server with `lamdera live`

## Browser Interaction with Dev Toolbar

### Accessing the Dev Toolbar
- The Dev Toolbar appears in the **bottom-left corner** of the page, showing "Env: Dev"
- The toolbar **expands on hover** (mouseover), not on click
- **Do NOT click directly on the "Env: Dev" text** - this opens an Env.mode selection modal
- Use `browser_hover` on the toolbar element first, then click on the desired option

### Opening the REPL
1. Hover over the Dev Toolbar to expand it
2. Click "Show Repl" to open the REPL panel
3. The REPL stays open even when the toolbar collapses (mouse leaves)
4. Click "Hide Repl" to close it

## Lamdera REPL Commands

Access Lamdera-specific commands by typing `:lamdera` in the REPL.

### Viewing Models
- `bem` - View the current Backend model (`Types.BackendModel`)
- `fem` - View the current Frontend model (`Types.FrontendModel`)

### Modifying Models
- `setBem <model>` - Set/replace the Backend model
- `setFem <model>` - Set/replace the Frontend model

### Sending Messages
- `updateBE <msg>` - Send a `BackendMsg` to the backend
- `updateFE <msg>` - Send a `FrontendMsg` to the frontend
- `sendToBE <msg>` - Send a `ToBackend` message
- `sendToFE <clientId> <msg>` - Send a `ToFrontend` message to a specific client
- `broadcast <msg>` - Broadcast a `ToFrontend` message to all connected clients

### Utilities
- `capture <value>` - Create a snapshot of a value for debugging. This avoids problems where the value may be mutated from other REPL calls.
- `:help` - Show general REPL help
- `:exit` - Exit the REPL

- Lamdera general docs: https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs

## Linting
- After making code changes to `*.elm` files, run `elm-review` to check for linting errors
- Fix any elm-review errors before considering the task complete
- Common elm-review rules in this project:
  - `NoExposingEverything` - Use explicit exports instead of `exposing (..)`
  - `NoImportingEverything` - Use explicit imports instead of `import X exposing (..)`
  - `NoMissingTypeAnnotation` - All top-level definitions need type annotations
  - `NoUnused.*` - Remove unused code (variables, imports, dependencies, etc.)

## Testing with lamdera/program-test

### Running Tests
- Run tests with `elm-test` from the project root
- Tests are located in `tests/SmokeTests.elm`

### Test Viewer (Visual Debugging)
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/tests/SmokeTests.elm` to see an interactive test timeline
- The test viewer shows a visual timeline of all events (backend init, frontend connect, messages, etc.)
- Click on "clientId 0" to select the frontend client view
- Use **arrow keys (Left/Right)** to step through the timeline and see the view at each point
- The timestamp and current event are shown at the bottom of the screen
- This is extremely helpful for debugging test failures - you can see exactly what the DOM looks like at each step

### Test Structure
```elm
Effect.Test.start
    "Test description"
    (Effect.Time.millisToPosix 1767225600000)  -- Set the simulated time (Jan 1, 2026)
    config
    [ Effect.Test.connectFrontend
        1000  -- Delay before connecting (ms)
        (Effect.Lamdera.sessionIdFromString "sessionId0")
        "/"   -- URL path
        { width = 800, height = 600 }  -- Viewport size
        (\client1 ->
            [ client1.checkView 100 (... query ...)
            ]
        )
    ]
```

### HTML Query Selectors - IMPORTANT GOTCHAS

#### The `containing` selector matches parent elements too!
- `Test.Html.Selector.containing [ text "1/2" ]` will match ANY element that contains "1/2" anywhere in its subtree
- This includes the day cell, the week row, the calendar, the card, the whole page body
- If you then check `.has [ text "-" ]`, it may pass because a parent element contains both "1/2" (from one cell) AND "-" (from a different cell)
- **Solution**: Use more specific selectors like `data-testid` attributes

#### Using data-testid attributes for reliable selection
- Add `attribute "data-testid" "day-2026-01-02"` to elements you need to select in tests
- Use `Test.Html.Query.find [ Test.Html.Selector.attribute (Html.Attributes.attribute "data-testid" "day-2026-01-02") ]` to find specific elements
- This is much more reliable than trying to match by text content or CSS classes

#### Example of a reliable test selector:
```elm
client1.checkView 100
    (Test.Html.Query.find 
        [ Test.Html.Selector.attribute 
            (Html.Attributes.attribute "data-testid" "day-2026-01-02") 
        ]
        >> Test.Html.Query.has [ Test.Html.Selector.text "-" ]
    )
```

### Debugging Tests with Debug.log
- You can use `Debug.log` inside tests to print values during test execution
- The output appears in the terminal when running `elm-test`
- Be careful where you place Debug.log - putting it around the comparison value (e.g., `Expect.greaterThan (Debug.log "count" 0)`) logs the comparison value, not the actual result
- For debugging query results, use `Test.Html.Query.count` with an expectation to see how many elements match

### Time Simulation
- The second argument to `Effect.Test.start` sets the simulated start time
- Use `Effect.Time.millisToPosix` with milliseconds since Unix epoch
- Example: January 1, 2026 00:00:00 UTC = `1767225600000`
- All `Effect.Time.now` and `Effect.Time.here` calls in the frontend will use this simulated time

### Common Test Actions
- `client.checkView delay (query)` - Check the view after a delay
- `client.clickButton "Button text"` - Click a button
- `client.inputText "input-id" "text"` - Type into an input
- `Effect.Test.checkBackend delay checkFunc` - Check the backend model
